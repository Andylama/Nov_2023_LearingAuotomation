 * *   0 to 100% abstraction.
     * Absrtract class can have both abstract(undefined/unimplemented) methods and concrete(simple/regular) methods.
     * Concrete Class(Simple/Regular) Class can extend an abstract Class( partent) but it has to implement
       the undefined methods of the abstract Class.
     * Can not create the Object of Abstract Class.                                                                          */
