/*                                                                
	 * In Java we can make Child Class and Parent Class, Child class can inherit the
	  properties of parent Class under certain conditions yes there are certain
	  restictions.
	  Inheritance:--
	  
	 * Inheritance is inheriating the properties  of parent class into child class.
	 * Inhertiance in java is a mechanism in which one object (child) acquires all the
	   properties and behaviors of a parent object.
	 * Inheritance represents the  IS-A relationship which is also known as parent-child relationship.
	 
	     
	 *  For Example:
	 *  Dog is child Class  >>>> Animal  is parent Class.
	 *  Car is child Class  >>>> Vehicle is parent Class. 
	 *  Surgeon is child Class >>>> Doctor is parent Class.
	  
	 *   What is the advantages of Inheritance?
	 *   1.Code reusability.
	 *   2. It promotes runtime polymorphism by allowing method oveeriding.
	 *    
	 *   What is the diadvantages of Inheritance?
	 *   1. The parent and child classes get tightly coupled. 
	 *    
	 *    Inheritance is achieved by using  the "EXTENDS" Keyword.
	 *    
	 *                                                                        
	 *   What do not take part in inheritance?
	 *   1. Contructors
	 *   A child class can inherit all the members( Fields, Methods, Nested Classes) from its parent class. Constructors are not members, so they
	 *   can not be inheritaed by the child class.But the constructor of the parent class can be invoked from the child class.                                                                     
	 *                                                                        
	 *    2. Private memberes
	 *    A Child class does not inherit the private members of its parent Class. However if the parent
	 *    clas has public or protected methods  like( getters and setters) for accesing its private fields,
	 *    these can be used by the Child Class.                                                                  
	 *   
	 *   Note 1.:  There can be only one parent class because jave does not support multiple inheritance.                                                                    B
	 *   Note 2.:  Parent clas is also known as super class and Child class is also know as Sub Class.
	 *     Types of Inheritance in Java:-
	     1. Single inheritance- One child class extends one parent class.
	     2. Multilevel inheritance :- Grandparent is the parent of parentClass and Parent Class is the parent of Child Class.
	                                  so Child class extends GrandParent Class indrectly. 
	      3. Heirarchical inheritance: One parent class is inherited by mulitple child classes.                                                                 
	 *                                                                        
	 *                                                                        
	 *                                                                        
	 *                                                                        
	 *                                                                        
	 *                                                                        
	 *
