/*   Data Structure : way to store  data in the memory in an efficent way. 
 *   Data Structue is basically divided into 2 types:
 *   1. Primitive DS
 *   2. Non Primitive DS
 *   
 *   Non Primitive Data Structure is further divided into 2 Types:
 *   1. Linear DS     : String, Arrays, List , Set, Queue, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, LinkedHashSet.
 *   2. Non Linear DS : Graphs and Trees
 *  
 *    Efficient : Time and space complexities
 *    
 *   Java has 8 primitive data types and we can store data in a very simple fashion.   
 *   
 *     Difference beween Primitive and Non Primitive DS
 *     1. Primitive DS can not hold mulitiple data
 *     2. Primitive DS can be used to wirte a simple programs such as Calculator, Currency Converter.
 *     1. Non Primitive DS can be used to write large scale applications such as E-commerce, Social Networking, Banking                                         
 *     
 *     Algorithms need very strong data backup
 *     Reason we learing: Collection Framework is part Of Non Primitive DS and it is nothing but a pre -defined API.                                        
 *                                              
 *                                              */
