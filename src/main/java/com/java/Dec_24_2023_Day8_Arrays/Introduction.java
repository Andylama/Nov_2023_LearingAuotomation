	/// What is an Array ?
	// Array is an object that holds a fixed number of values of homogeneous or similar data type
	// Array is a data structure in which we store similar element
	// Length of the array is decided/ determined at the time of creation and once created. remains fixed.
	// Indexing position of an array starts with Zero.
	// What are the Features of Array ?
	// Indexing starts from zero
	// Any Java arrary variable can be declared like other variables with a  dimension [].
	// All the variable in the array are ordered.
	// Since arrays are objects,therefore it occupies memory space.
	// Direct Super Class of an Array is Object Class.
	// Object Class is the parent of all classes in Java.
	// Arraus are always created at runtime.
	// Length of an Array can be determined by using the member length.
	// The  elements of an Array are stored in consecutive memory locations.
	
	// Advantage of Array ?
	
	// Stores multiple data items using a single name.
	// We can access andy element randoly by using indexes.
	// Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Graphs,Trees etc.
	// Primitive data types to Wrapper Class Objects  will not happen in case of arrays, Hence they are faster in operation.
		
	//Disvantages of Array ?
	
	// fixed size.
	// Memory wastage.
	// Stongly typed.
	// Arrays do not have any add or remove methos.
	// Reduce performance
	
	// What kind of Arrays should we learn?
	//1.-Demensional Array.
	//2.-Demensional Array.
	//3. Dimensional Array.
	//   Jabbed Array.
	//   Object Array.
