/*     * What is an Interface?
Answer:   Interface is blueprint of a Class.
          It tells a Class what to do but it does not tell how to do.
          Methods inside the Interface are abstract and public.
          Interface is pure 100% Abstraction.
          In Interface Variable should be alawayas final, static and public
          From JDK 8 default concrete(Regular)  Methods were allowed.
          From JDK 9 private concrete(Regular)  Methods were allowed.
          From JDK 8 static  concrete(Regular)  Methods were allowed.
          
          Concrete Class is also called Regular/ Simple / Normal Class
          Concrete Class which implements the Interface is known as Implementing class of that Interface.
          One Concrete Class can implement multiple Interface.
          Interface is the only place where multiple inheritance is allowed in java.
          Whem a concrete Class implements an Interface, It also has to implement all the abstract Methods of Interface.
          A concrete Class can extend an Abstract Class as well as implement an Interface or implement Multiple Interfaces.
