/*   OOPS :- Object Oriented Programming [System or Structure]
 *    It is a programming paradigm [ways of doing programming]
 *    Types :--
 *    Procedural Programming.
 *    Functional Programming.
 *    Logical  Programming.
 *    Structured Programming.
 *                           
 *     OOPs in Java has 6 pillars
 *     1.Clas and Objects
 *     2. Methods
 *     3. Inheritance
 *     4. Polymorphism
 *     5. Abstraction [Abstract Class and Interface]
 *     6. Encapsulation                      
 *        
 *    Let us understand Class :-  
 *    If the Orginal class can be defined as a public or default then the nested class can only be defined as default.
 *                       
 *    If yoiu consider Java, broadly Classes are defined in 2 Types:
 *     1. Pre- defined Classes.
 *     2. User- defined Classes.                       
 *                           
 *       Pre defined Classes in Java:-- String, ClassLoader, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, AbstractAction,Popup, System.            
 *       
 *    What is the problem if a user tries to replicate the same Name of the Class which is already pre defined ?
 *  Answere:   Do not create  a User defined clas which is equivalent to Pre defined Class in Java. If you do this, then the compiler will get confused.          
 *              
 *    what is a Class?
 *    It is a blueprint or a template which allows you to convey your logic.
 *    it represents set of propertiess that are common to all object of one type.
 *    Class does not occupy memory because it is not a physical entity. 
 *    Class is logical entity.
 *    Collection f Objects, Methods, Constructors,variab les, Blocks, NestedClass.
 *    Road:- Road is a Class which gives you a platform to drive your cars.
 *  
 *    
 *    What are the access modifiers that can be used for a Class?
 *    public and default. You cannot use Private and Protected  to define a Class.
 *    
 *                
 *                
 *                                                            */
